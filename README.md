# Sentinnel-Connect
Sentinel Connect is a military-grade secure communications platform that enables encrypted messaging, emergency coordination, family connectivity, and professional training resources. It is designed for field agents, command centers, and their families to stay connected while maintaining top-level security and confidentiality.

Overview

Sentinel Connect is designed to be used in sensitive environments where confidentiality, integrity, and availability are required. The system separates responsibilities between front-end clients, back-end services, and persistent storage, and enforces security at every layer.

Features

End-to-end encrypted messaging for one-to-one and group conversations

Secure family portal for non-operational updates and scheduled video calls

Emergency services module with verified contacts and location-aware support

Training hub for mission-critical courses, materials, and certifications

Role-based access control with security classifications: Unclassified, Secret, Top-Secret

Audit logging and monitoring hooks for accountability

Tech stack

Frontend: React.js and Tailwind CSS

Backend: Node.js with Express framework

Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (configurable based on operational needs)

Security: TLS/HTTPS for transport, AES-256 for data encryption at rest, and secure key management

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and role-based authorization

Setup and installation

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Nidhi-hb/Sentinnel-Connect.git

Change into the project directory

cd Sentinnel-Connect

Install dependencies for the server and client (if separate)

npm install

Create a configuration file named .env in the project root with the following variables:

PORT=3000

DB_URI=your_database_connection_string

JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_256bit_encryption_key

Start the development server

npm run dev

Open the application in your browser at https://localhost:3000 or the configured host and port

Configuration notes

DB_URI should include credentials and host information in a secure manner (use a secrets manager in production)

JWT_SECRET must be a long, random string and treated as a secret

ENCRYPTION_KEY must be 256 bits for AES-256 encryption and rotated periodically

Security considerations

Always run the service behind a TLS-terminating reverse proxy or load balancer

Use hardware security modules or cloud key management for storing encryption keys

Enable audit logging to capture critical operations and access events

Apply role-based access control consistently across APIs and UI components

Use multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts

Development workflow

Create a feature branch for each change

git checkout -b feature/short-description

Make changes and run tests locally

npm test

Commit with a clear message

git add . git commit -m "short, descriptive message"

Push the branch and open a pull request for review

git push origin feature/short-description

Deployment

Containerize the server using Docker and follow your organization's CI/CD pipeline

Ensure environment variables are supplied securely by the deployment system

Configure scalable database and storage options appropriate for load

Monitor application health and set up alerts for critical metrics
